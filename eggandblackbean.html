                                If you are looking for a cheap, nutritious breakfast you can eat on the go, look no further than this recipe for egg and black bean burritos.
<br>
<br>

The idea is simple: Start by heating some tortillas on the griddle. While they heat, scramble a dozen eggs and heat a can of black beans on the stovetop.
<br>
<br>

Once your eggs are scrambled, assemble your breakfast burritos and add any extras you might want. Toppings like shredded cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce all work rather well. (You can also make these in bulk and freeze them so theyâ€™re ready to heat up on a hectic weekday morning. Feel free to add other toppings such as bacon to personalise your meal.)
