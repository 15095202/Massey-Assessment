                    The origin of Student Food:
                  </h1>

                  <p>
                    Worldwide, people aged between 16-24 spend more money on food then any other demographic in the world.
                    <br> These people are typically branded as 'millennials' and are typically students.
                    <br>While globaly, tradtional cooking seems to be deminishing in this demographic, there is a wealth
                    <br> of information, techniques and skills learnable in 5 minutes which will empower students to make healthy
                    <br> nutritious and delicous food quickly and cheaply right on the internet. StudentFood aims to make this information
                    <br> easily available, on the go on a phone or in the kitchen with easily comprehensable ingrediants lists, prices, and
                    <br> recipes. With an accompanying youtube channel for visual reinforcement, StudentFood aims to be a hub of low cost deliciousness.
