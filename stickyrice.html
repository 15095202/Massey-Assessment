                All you need to do is steam some rice, dump a can of vegetables (or a bag of frozen veggies) in a microwave-safe bowl and heat them up,or fire them in a pan. Then mix the vegetables and rice together with just the right amount of soy sauce as suits your taste. These three ingredients may not make a flashy meal, but the concoction is fairly healthy, cheap, and easy.
