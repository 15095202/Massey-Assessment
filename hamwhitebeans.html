                                   This meal, shared by Amy 'reminds me deeply of growing up. Each New Years Day, my parents would make an enormous pot of ham and white beans and then invite lots of friends and family to eat with us. My mom would make a huge pan of cornbread and the mixture of the aromas would just fill the house. This recipe will help you whip up a pot of ham-and-beans that wont be forgotten.'
